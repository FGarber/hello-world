# Hello World
This is a page for the sample "Hello World" tutorial.
I am learning to use GitHub as a place for me and my projects, and i don't forsee letting other people commit to my projects.
Unless, of course, I become super rich and famous.
I wonder if Heather and I could use this software to collaborately write a novel?
We certainly could use GitHub to build a game together, with me branching the Artwork, and her committing it back into the Unity files.
